# Bandcamp Onboarding

## Welcome, Mad War!

### Genre 

Your genre selection determines where your music appears in Bandcamp Discover. It’s OK if you don’t fit perfectly within one of these - just use the genre tag field, below, to provide more granularity.

- select one

### Genre tag(s) 

Optional. Use a comma to separate multiple tags.

### Location 

- e.g., Seattle, WA

## Your URL

One last thing. Your address on Bandcamp will be:

- madwar.bandcamp.com

If you prefer to set this up as a custom domain (e.g., “music.madwar.com”), you can do that later, as part of Bandcamp Pro.
